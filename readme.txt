    Installing the Program
==========================================

             Mac
--------------------------------

Place the file installationmac.sh inside the folder
where you would like the program to be installed. 
The installer will create a new directory inside that
folder for the program.

The installer installs the following software on your 
computer:
--Homebrew
--Git
--cURL
--SEO-Searcher
--Python3 (Should be preinstalled)
--Required dependencies and libraries for the scraper


Future installation files coming.

===============================================
        Using the Program
===============================================
1.) Run search.sh
2.) When prompted, input the following:
        Keyword
        URL to be scraper
        Tags to be searched
    
    note- the keyword should be entered capitalized,
      and the program will search in a "case-insensitive"
      manner. the tags should be exactly as they appear
      in the html file, and separated only by spaces.

3.) Your results are displayed on the screen, and
      if it does not already exist, a log file is 
      created that shows the keyword, url, and date
      and time that the search was done. The results
      are NOT stored, the user must store them.
